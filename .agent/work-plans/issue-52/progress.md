# Issue #52 — Resend amplification under real link degradation

## Plan Authored
**Status**: complete
**When**: 2026-08-22 11:25 -04:00
**By**: Claude Code Agent (Claude Opus 5 (1M context))

**Plan**: `.agent/work-plans/issue-52/plan.md` at `036a716`
**Branch**: feature/issue-52 at `036a716` (stacked on `feature/issue-18` / PR #27, unmerged)
**Phases**: single PR with atomic commits by default; may split into three
(admission scaling / resend-budget basis / bench invariant)

Root cause refined while planning: it is not that AIMD is too slow. **Every
control parameter is scaled by `data_rate_limit_`** — the additive increase
step (`0.1 x cap` = +400 kB/s per clean sample on a 62.5 kB/s link), the
admission floor (`0.1 x cap`), and transitively the resend budget
(`0.25 x effective`). The additive step is the immediate defect: one clean
sample undoes three halvings, which is why the measured cap oscillated around
2291 kB/s and never even reached its own 400 kB/s floor. The delivery signal
itself is sound and needs no wire-protocol change; what changes is what the
step sizes and floors are measured against.

`maximum_bytes_per_second` is explicitly NOT removed — it stays as a hard
ceiling and as cost control on metered cell links. Only its implicit second
job, acting as the model of link capacity, goes away.

### Open questions
- [ ] Absolute floor value — what rate must always be admitted? (suggest 4–8 kB/s from the critical tier + BridgeInfo; boat's real control set should decide)
- [ ] Headroom target — aim for a fraction of measured capacity (prevents lockout by construction) or merely avoid overshoot? The former is a behaviour change beyond fixing the scaling.
- [ ] Deprecate `admission_floor_fraction` outright or keep one release?
- [ ] One PR with atomic commits, or three stacked PRs?
- [ ] If PR #27 merges first, rebase this branch onto `jazzy` before opening the PR.

## Implementation
**Status**: complete (first pass) — dominant cause fixed, residual documented
**When**: 2026-08-22 11:57 -04:00
**By**: Claude Code Agent (Claude Opus 5 (1M context))

**Branch**: feature/issue-52 at `cc756a5`, stacked on `feature/issue-18`
(PR #27, unmerged). Not pushed; no PR opened.

### Operator decisions applied (2026-08-22)
Absolute floor configurable with a default (`admission_floor_bytes_per_second`,
8192); headroom in scope, configurable with a default
(`link_headroom_fraction`, 0.2); `admission_floor_fraction` dropped outright;
one PR.

### Changes (4 atomic commits after the plan)
1. `admission:` AIMD step relative to the CURRENT effective cap (absolute
   minimum 2048 B/s) instead of a fraction of the configured limit; absolute
   floor clamped at use to the configured limit; congested samples target
   `(1 - headroom) x goodput`; goodput = remote received MINUS remote
   duplicates. Headroom applied only on the congested branch — goodput is
   bounded by offered load, so it is a lower bound on capacity, not an
   estimate; clamping unconditionally would ratchet a healthy idle link to
   nothing. Stale feedback keeps the plain halving (no goodput reading).
2. `resend:` budget basis moved from `effective_rate_limit_` to goodput.
   Probe guarantee re-gated on the resend FRACTION rather than the computed
   budget — a zero budget now also means "no goodput sample yet" or "link
   delivering nothing", exactly the cases the trickle exists for.
3. `docs:` both design notes rewritten around goodput scaling, with the
   per-phase bench table and a section on what the rate limit is now for;
   example_params.yaml + README parameter table.
4. `bench:` `cotenant.py` + `test_invariant_cotenant_management_flow_survives`.

### Measured result (same trajectory, before vs after; kB/s)
| phase | link | cap before | cap after | resend before | resend after | r/m before | r/m after |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| in_range_clean | 3750 | 3346 | 36.4 | 0.34 | 0.37 | 0.044 | 0.048 |
| fringe | 1250 | 2600 | 33.3 | 0.38 | 0.15 | 0.045 | 0.018 |
| lossy | 375 | 2480 | 30.4 | 13.94 | **0.59** | 1.643 | **0.077** |
| critical | 62.5 | 2291 | 14.1 | 26.36 | **0.90** | 3.108 | **0.144** |
| over_horizon | — | 860 | 12.4 | 3.22 | 1.35 | 0.379 | 0.185 |

Resend traffic down **24x at lossy, 29x at critical**. Duplicates at critical
3.45 -> 0.38 kB/s. The effective cap now tracks the link instead of the
config: 14.1 kB/s on a 62.5 kB/s path, against 2291 kB/s before.

**The co-tenant invariant passes.** `test_invariant_recovery_completeness`
also still passes, so the slower recovery stays within the harness's own
X=0.90-within-T=30 s criterion.

### Residual — resend invariant still xfailed
`critical`, the worst phase, now passes its ceiling with margin. Two low-loss
phases remain just over: fringe 0.018 vs 0.010, lossy 0.077 vs 0.060.
Duplicates are ~34% of the remaining resend traffic at lossy, which points at
spurious re-requests (debounce / reorder-window interaction at short RTT)
rather than the cap-scaling defect #52 documents. `xfail(strict=True)` kept,
reason updated with these numbers. `F_resend_multiplier` untouched.

### Verification
- Default suite: **165 tests, 0 errors, 0 failures** (2 new admission tests +
  1 new bench invariant).
- Opt-in `range_degradation`: **8 pass, 1 xfail, 0 failures**.
- flake8 clean.

### Open questions
- [ ] Chase the low-loss residual in this PR, or land the 24-29x win and file it separately? It looks like a different mechanism (re-request debounce vs cap scaling).
- [ ] Push and open the PR now, or hold until PR #27 merges so this can rebase onto `jazzy` rather than stay stacked?
- [ ] Still unexplained from PR #27: `msg` sits at ~7-8 kB/s in every phase including a clean 3.75 MB/s link — the Bulk tier never reaches the wifi connection's counters. Does not affect these conclusions but deserves its own look.
